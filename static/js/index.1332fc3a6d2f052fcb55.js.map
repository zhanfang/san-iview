<p>我们采用了24栅格系统，将区域进行24等分，这样可以轻松应对大部分布局问题。使用栅格系统进行网页布局，可以使页面排版美观、舒适。</p>\\n        <p>我们定义了两个概念，行<code>row</code>和列<code>col</code>，具体使用方法如下：</p>\\n        <ul>\\n            <li>使用<code>row</code>在水平方向创建一行</li>\\n            <li>将一组<code>col</code>插入在<code>row</code>中</li>\\n            <li>在每个<code>col</code>中，键入自己的内容</li>\\n            <li>通过设置<code>col</code>的<code>span</code>参数，指定跨越的范围，其范围是1到24</li>\\n            <li>每个<code>row</code>中的<code>col</code>总和应该为24</li>\\n        </ul>\\n        <anchor title=\\\"代码示例\\\"
